## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Preparation (Python)

- Loaded raw dataset with Pandas
- Cleaned nulls, filtered invalid data
- Generated descriptive stats: mean, median, std, quartiles
- Created time-based features (hour, day, month, weekday, peak indicator)
- Saved `uber_enhanced.csv` for Power BI

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Power BI Dashboard

- Imported enhanced dataset
- Built visuals:
  - Histogram & Box plot (fare distribution)
  - Hourly and Monthly ride trends
  - Pickup location map (Geo)
- Added slicers for interactivity
- Designed layout with clear titles, filters, and insights

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights

- Most rides have fare amounts between $5â€“$15
- Peak ride hours: 7â€“9 AM and 5â€“7 PM
- Friday has the highest number of rides
- NYC central region is the busiest pickup zone
